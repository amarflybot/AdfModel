# AdfModel
These are java models for comunicating with the UI code for [angular-dashboard-framework](https://github.com/angular-dashboard-framework).

We can leverage [adf-dynamic](https://github.com/angular-dashboard-framework/adf-dynamic-example) to communicate between client side 
and server side.

The library used are: 
1. [jackson-binding](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind/2.7.2)
2. [json](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json/20160212)
